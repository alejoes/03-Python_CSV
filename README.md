# 03-Python_CSV
Handle CSV files in Python (PyBank)
I created an algorithm that would process a csv file of two columns, Date & Amounts, and 
perform a series of calculations like check the total lenght of the period, (date should be 
provided m/d/yyyy), difference of income from one period to the other and the average of those 
differences, it also calculates the greatest increase and greatest decrease from one period to the
other

(PyPoll)
here I handle a file with the results of an election, I count the votes for each candidate and make a report.
